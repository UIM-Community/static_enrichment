# Static_enrichment
CA UIM - Asynchronous Static message enrichment

This probe is designed to enrich alarm statically by matching a single field with a perl regexp. All messages are handled in a multithread pool to allow the maximum performance possible. All fields can be overwritted and used in the following rules...

The probe will attach to a queue namned '**static_enrichment**'. This queue can be overwritted with the configuration key setup/queue_attach.

> Warning: Dont configure this probe with to much threads and stay resonnable on the queue bulk_size. This script is capable to process hundreds of thousands of messages in less than one second (The hub will break because of the storm generated by the probe).

# Features 

- Allow to overwrite or create new fields.
- Allow to chain rules.
- High-speed Asynchronous enrichment (no performance degradation like NAS or AlarmEnrichment). 
- Alarm_enrichment configuration like ! 

# Benchmark 

- A single thread can take around 400 - 1000 alarms every seconds with few rules. It surely depend on the system configuration!

# Configuration 

> field setup/login and setup/password **are only required when the script is executed in a terminal**.

```xml

# Roadmap v1.1

- Ability to drop message
- Define enrichment scenarios (Road of rules to follow)
